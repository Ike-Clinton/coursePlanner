The Citadel Course Planner
===

Course Planner is a Rails app designed to help students plan their courses
for the coming semester. It is currently a work in progress and functionality
may be limited during testing. YMMV.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
Built on <pre>ruby '2.2.2'</pre>

* Rails version
Built with <pre>gem 'rails',  '4.2.1'</pre>

* System dependencies
Review Gemfile and Gemfile.lock for other dependencies and required Gems

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
  BDD Testing is done with the command 'cucumber'
  Rspec may be invoked with 'rspec -fd'
